This blog is respecting your privacy by:

 - Not using any `JavaScript` code whatsoever.

 - Being 100% transparent and public. [1]

 - Tunneling all communications through TLS. (Or simply being HTTPS-only.)

 - Not relying on any 3rd party NS servers for running its DNS records.

 - Having 0 line of code from Google(or any other 3rd party vendors) in its
 contents.

 - Not using any "analytic" services or webmaster tools.

 - Self-hosting all web fonts.

 - Not using any kind of cookies.

 - Nothing server-side and having all pages as pre-generated `.html` files.

To be updated perhaps. That's all I can notice for now.

**NOTE** GitHub may change its policies and technologies at any time.
