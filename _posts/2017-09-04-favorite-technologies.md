Really hard to explain how do I feel about each of them. In no particular order:

 - `nginx`: Probably what made me totally shocked. First I discovered it when
 I was trying to "reverse" some of the technologies that Facebook were using
 and I was wondering "what is this `nginx` dude, which is not `lighttpd`?"

 - `OpenBSD`: Keep calm and <3 the puffy!

 - `x264`: Dunno, was somehow very interesting. Specially with `ffmpeg` and
 a `rtmp` module on `nginx`.

 - `Bittorrent`: Totally life-changer, specially after the `emule` era. 

 - `Redis`: Was[is] a lot better than ramfs.

 - `php`: A non-C C interpreter. Love at the first sight?

 - `pf`: Firewall said anyone? It's just more than that.

 - `Assembler`: Love / hate relationship. "I love you, I'll kill you"

 - `Rust`: We'll see. Hype is gone and now it's time for some real actions.

To be updated.
