Think of an array as a collection of several variables which are having the
 same name but meanwhile, each block(or "internal variable") has its own
 unique index id.

The variable:

```
my_num
+-----+
|  7  |
+-----+
```

And here is the array:

```
        my_array
+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  9  |  5  |  3  |  7  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```

It's a very simple array with 4 elements. Each block(or element) of the array
 has its own index. Array indexes are numeric and also **starting at ZERO!**:

```
        my_array            <-- name of the array
+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  9  |  5  |  3  |  7  |       <-- values
+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   0     1     2     3          <-- indexes
```

For retreiving a value, in English we'd say "What is stored at the 1st block of
 my array?" but in C, we're actually referring to that block as the 0st one![1]

wat? 0st? as in 1st? and 2nd and third?

Yes! They are literally starting at 0st index and in fact, the last block of
 your array has the index of 3. (0 to 3)

For defining(or declaring or creating) an array in C, we just add square
 brackets, open and close, right after the "variable" name and by doing
 so we can turn our simple variable into a "multi-block variable":

```c_cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){

  int my_array[] = { 9, 5, 3, 7 };

  return 0;
}
```

And if we don't know the initial values, we can use:

```c_cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){

  int my_array[4];

  return 0;
}
```

**NOTE:** Just like the variables, if you define your arrays **WITHOUT** the
 initial values, they may(read it: **WILL**) contain some random junks:

```c_cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){

  int my_array[4];

  printf("%d\n", my_array[0]);
  printf("%d\n", my_array[1]);
  printf("%d\n", my_array[2]);
  printf("%d\n", my_array[3]);

  return 0;
}
```

If you're coming from another progamming language such as PHP or any other
 "on the fly" one, you should know that the C does not support any of those
 runtime "features" and each name is unique and bound to a specific type of
 data.
 (And that's not true about **void pointers** however. Later you'll see how
 they're working.)

And if you are not, dude! you can **NOT** turn a variable into an array or
 an array into a variable right in the middle of your code! You just can't!

The following code will result in compile error: [2]

```c_cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){

  int my_number = 123;

  printf("My number is %d.\n", my_number);

  my_number[] = { 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 };

  return 0;
}
```

Which means, you're doing it the wrong way! (Don't even try to "bypass" the
 compile errors, ever!)

Now that you know how to declare them, you may want to know how you can change
 the value of any specific block as well:

```c_cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){

  int my_array[] = {0, 0, 0, 0};

  my_array[0] = 2;
  my_array[1] = 3;
  my_array[2] = 5;
  my_array[3] = 8;

  printf("%d\n", my_array[0]);
  printf("%d\n", my_array[1]);
  printf("%d\n", my_array[2]);
  printf("%d\n", my_array[3]);

  return 0;
}
```
Yeah, just like the variables! (Variables on steroids.)

Here is what happened in that code:

Initialization:

```
        my_array
+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   0     1     2     3
```

Setting the actual values: (Before printing)

```
        my_array
+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  2  |  3  |  5  |  8  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   0     1     2     3
```

And that's it!

Now you know pretty much all you need for the next lesson, which is going to be
 about, "string"s. (Yeah, with double-quotes since the C is technically
 referring to them as **array of chars**.) 

Practice, practice, and practice!

**C** you soon!
